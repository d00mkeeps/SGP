# Welcome!

This is my smart gym planner app. I'm just learning to use Github right now, so this repository may not reflect the complete projct.

# What is it?

Well, that's a tough one. 'It' could've been anything, but I decided to make a gym planner. The planner has the following features planned or implemented:
- Workout tracking (exercises, sets+reps, etc)
- Historical progress visualisation
- LLM integration

# Who can use it

If you're name isn't Miles Hillary, good luck creating an account, you're gonna need it.
